Queremos crear actores mas complejos, para ello necesitamos entender cuando los metodos de un Actor
son llamados

- receive
- preStart
- postStop
- preRestart
- postRestart

The actor’s constructor --> An actor’s constructor is called just like any other Scala class constructor, when an instance of the class
is first created.

preStart --> Called right after the actor is started. During restarts it’s called by the default implementation of
postRestart .

postStop -->Called after an actor is stopped, it can be used to perform any needed cleanup work. According to the
Akka documentation, this hook “is guaranteed to run after message queuing has been disabled for this
actor.”

preRestart --> According to the Akka documentation, when an actor is restarted, the old actor is informed of the process
when preRestart is called with the exception that caused the restart, and the message that triggered
the exception. The message may be None if the restart was not caused by processing a message.

postRestart --> The postRestart method of the new actor is invoked with the exception that caused the restart. In
the default implementation, the preStart method is called.
