Queremos detener a uno o a mas actores de Akka, las mas comunes son:
 - system.stop(actorRef) en el ActorSystem 
 	actorSystem.stop(anActor)
 - context.stop(actorRef) dentro del actor
 	context.stop(childActor)
 
Otra de las maneras de detener a un actor:
 - enviar al actor PoisonPill
 	actor ! PoisonPill
 - programar un gracefulStop
 
stop method --> The actor will continue to process its current message (if any), but no additional messages will be
processed. See additional notes in the paragraphs that follow.

PoisonPill message --> A PoisonPill message will stop an actor when the message is processed. A PoisonPill
message is queued just like an ordinary message and will be handled after other messages queued
ahead of it in its mailbox.

gracefulStop method --> Lets you attempt to terminate actors gracefully, waiting for them to timeout. The documentation
states that this is a good way to terminate actors in a specific order.
